Farmers
</h1>
<p>The word agriculture is derived from a Latin word- ager or agri meaning soil, and ‘culture’
 meaning cultivation of the soil. In modern terms, agriculture comprises “the art and science of
  cultivating the soil, growing crops and rearing livestock.”
  You can consider farming to be rather a complete system which includes inputs, processing, 
  and outputs. The inputs here are seeds, fertilizers, machinery, which then, undergoes operations
   like ploughing, sowing, irrigation, weeding, and harvesting. And thus, we get the final outputs 
   like crops, dairy and poultry products.
